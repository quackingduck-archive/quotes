Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars - mere globs of gas atoms. Nothing is 'mere'. I too can see stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more? The vastness of the heavens stretches my imagination - stuck on this carousel, my little eye can catch one-million-year-old light.
